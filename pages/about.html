            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are a community of Godot enthusiasts located in the heart of Texas in Austin! We meet weekly to discuss the state of Godot, offer code help, compare projects, discuss game design, and even talk about our favorite games!
            </p>
            <p class="spacer">
                We're currently following a bi-weekly format. A night one week will be dedicated to presenting and discussing ongoing projects, and the following week will be intended for the presentation of published titles by other creators. We follow this format to foster inspiration, to enable those without the means to be exposed to new mechanics and ways of play, and generally to try and expose and question the decisions that go into game making.
